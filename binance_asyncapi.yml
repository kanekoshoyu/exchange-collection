  title: Binance WebSocket API
  version: 1.0.0
  description: >
    The base endpoint is: `wss://ws-api.binance.com:443/ws-api/v3`

    If you experience issues with the standard 443 port, alternative port 9443
    is also available.

    The base endpoint for testnet is: `wss://testnet.binance.vision/ws-api/v3`

    A single connection to the API is only valid for 24 hours; expect to be
    disconnected after the 24-hour mark.

    WebSocket server will send a ping frame every 3 minutes.

    If the WebSocket server does not receive a pong frame back from the
    connection within a 10 minute period, the connection will be disconnected.

    When you receive a ping, you must send a pong with a copy of ping's payload
    as soon as possible.

    Unsolicited pong frames are allowed, but will not prevent disconnection. It
    is recommended that the payload for these pong frames are empty.

    Lists are returned in chronological order, unless noted otherwise.

    All timestamps are in milliseconds in UTC, unless noted otherwise.

    All field names and values are case-sensitive, unless noted otherwise.
